# CPP-Learning
Little projects to brush up on my C++ knowledge

## Building with cmake
Most of these projects use cmake.

To build:
1. Make a directory to put the built files into, and cd into that directory
```sh
mkdir build
cd build
```
2. Run cmake to generate the make files
```sh
cmake ..
```
3. Run make to compile the program
```sh
make
```
4. Run the output file
